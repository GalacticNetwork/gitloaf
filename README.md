# Gitloaf
Gitloaf an open source cdn that displays files from github with their correct content type headers.

Gitloaf caches file data for short periods of time in order to provide a quicker experience.

## CDN Sources
By default at our /cdn/ directory, we source files directly from raw.github.com.
You can use other sources via:
- /jsdelivr/
- /rawgithack/
- /rawgit/
- /gitcf/

# Warning
Games that run with large amounts of wasm types will get errors and be unable to load.
