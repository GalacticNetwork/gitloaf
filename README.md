# Gitloaf
Gitloaf an open sourced cdn that displays files from github with their correct content type headers. See a list of supported files here: https://gitloaf.albios.repl.co/filetypes.html Similar to raw.githack.com, except using nodejs and express instead of nginx configs.

Gitloaf caches file data for short periods of time in order to provide a quicker experience.
You can use the jsdelivr cdn instead of the github cdn by switching /cdn/ with /cfcdn/ in the url.
